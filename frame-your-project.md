# Apply best practices to frame your project

- Before diving into a dashboard development project, 
  here are some essential best practices that I use. 
- They are applicable regardless of the project method used 
  (PMI, SCRUM, Design Thinking)

## Best Practice #1: Meet with End Users

- Take the time to meet with end users to understand:

```
How they work on a daily basis.
How your project can serve their needs.
```

## Best Practice #2: Gather Stakeholders

- Organize a scoping workshop with representatives from each user group and your client to frame the work before starting.
- During this workshop, you can share the summary of interviews with end users and the elements of the client's initial scoping.

```
The objective is to ensure that the entire group is aligned on:

* The project scope;
* Success criteria;
* Project organization;
* The schedule.
```
## Best Practice #3: Create User Stories

- During the scoping workshop, ask each group member to create "User Stories." 
- These are functional requirements expressed in the form of use cases for future users.
- Gathering functional requirements in this format clearly indicates
  the beneficiary of the features and the desired business value.
- It also avoids expressing a solution instead of the actual need.

```
Before moving on to the next step, prioritization is necessary as you will often have dozens of User Stories to develop:

* Which User Stories bring the most value?
* Which ones do you think you can develop before the next checkpoint?
```
## Best Practice #4: Help the group envision through illustrations

- Take advantage of the scoping workshop to show illustrations of similar dashboards.
- The hardest part for your future users during the scoping phase is to envision 
  what they will do with your dashboard when they have never seen one!

## Best Practice #5: Prototype the solution with a wireframe

- In this final step of the scoping workshop, which I particularly enjoy, 
 we invite the group to draw, with your assistance, 
 the elements of the ideal dashboard using a marker and A1 or A0 size paper.

```
A wireframe is something done at the beginning of a project that requires the design of a graphical and digital interface. 
It helps ensure that everyone is aligned on the direction that will be taken.
```

## Best Practice #6: Set Regular Milestones

- Avoid the tunnel effect!

```
This will allow you to:

* validate the dashboard creation step by step;
* avoid wasting weeks of development by realizing too late that an initial assumption was incorrect.
```
