## Why use Power BI?

```
The data to be used for the project has been transmitted. 

* To consolidate different data tables, clean them, transform them, and aggregate them.

```

```  

- What precautions should be taken before starting dashboard development ?

- Which of these formulations follows the rules for writing a User Story ?

```
As a { WHO } I want { WHAT } So that { WHY }

A User Story should be specific to the need and expected business benefit without expressing a solution. 

The objective of User Stories is to list functional requirements 
so that you can prioritize them and evaluate different ways to address them.

This formulation correctly follows the standard template for writing user stories. 

It consists of three key components:

"As a" - identifies the user or role (WHO)
"I want" - describes the desired functionality or action (WHAT)
"So that" - explains the purpose or value (WHY)
