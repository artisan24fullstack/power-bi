# Tables and Matrices, Slicers

- Tables and matrices should be used when you want to display your raw data (numbers, text, categories...) as in an Excel spreadsheet.
  
```
You can choose which dimensions to display, and even make groupings (e.g., sums, averages) or selections (e.g., display maximum values).

The table allows you to compare dimensions from different tables.
```

## The matrix facilitates clear data display across multiple dimensions: 

```
it supports a staggered layout like a pivot table. 

The matrix automatically aggregates data and allows exploration at a lower granularity level.
```

## Slicers are not visualizations but filters ! 

```
They allow you to interact with other visualizations on your dashboard by selecting a subset of the data. 

Tip 1: 

You can select multiple elements at once by holding down the CTRL key on your keyboard. 

Tip 2: 

By default, list slicer elements are sorted in ascending order. 

To reverse the sort order and use descending order, 
select the ellipsis (...) in the top right corner of the slicer, 
and choose Sort descending.
