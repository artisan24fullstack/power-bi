# Graphs

- Graphs are the most common visualizations for displaying data. 

## You probably know many of them; among them:

### Pie charts

- They show the relationship of parts of the data to a whole. 

``` 
For example, the amounts of loan applications in 2018 compared to all loan applications.
``` 

### Line graphs

- They show the evolution of a series of values over time. 
  
``` 
For example, the evolution of loan applications by branch, to compare their business activities.
``` 

### Bar charts and histograms

- They are used to visualize specific values in different categories.  

``` 
For example, loan applications by branch.

In Power BI, there are stacked versions of these charts. 

This allows you to display approved and rejected loans by year, for example.
