# Cards and Maps

## Cards (simple) or (multi-row)

- Cards are essentially "tiles" used to display the value of an indicator (simple card) or a selection of values (multi-row card).
  
```
The simple card allows you to display "in large" the number of pending loan requests, 
for example, as a key indicator of activity backlog.

The multi-row card can display more than a single value; 
for instance, you can show a formatted customer identity card with their name, surname, and family situation.
```

## Maps

- Maps are an excellent way to display your data when there's a geographical dimension you can exploit: 
your data appears as bubbles on locations.

```
You can adjust the size of the bubbles, 
for example, to show the location of branches and their respective importance by customer volume.

Maps allow your users to project themselves into their environment 
and are very effective in simply representing complex information. 

Therefore, they should be used whenever possible
