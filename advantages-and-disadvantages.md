# Advantages and disadvantages 
## Understand of each visualization

### Pie Charts

```
✓ Simple to use for representing a whole as the sum of its parts.
× Difficult for the eye to compare the size of pie slices.
× Beyond 4 slices, they become unreadable.
```

### Line Graphs

```
✓ Very practical for representing the evolution of a numerical variable.
× When there are too many overlapping lines, there's a risk of the "spaghetti plate" effect.
```

## Bar Charts

```
✓ The most effective chart for representing numerical values by category.
× Data is often grouped, which can influence the interpretation of the end user.
× If the data is not sorted, they can be difficult to read.
```

### Treemaps

```
✓ Optimal use of space allows for representing a lot of data simultaneously.
× If there's no variance in your data, it has little value.
```

### Maps

```
✓ They allow projecting the end user into their environment.
× Unreadable if there are too many points.
× Maps often have basic colors (sea, continent...), so be careful with color management.
