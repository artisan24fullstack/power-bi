# Follow the key steps for impactful visualization

- When working on designing visualizations for a dashboard, 
  always ask yourself the following questions:
  
```
What: What data does your user want to visualize?

* Based on this, you will not choose the same type of visualization.

Why: Why does your user want to visualize this data?

* This question has a strong impact on the choice of visualization 
and the interaction you need to implement. 
* Does the user want to identify a trend ? 
* Correlations between variables ? 
* Search for a particular value ?

How: Finally, ask yourself how to present the data to your user.

* Does the user want to display it sorted ? Filtered ?
* Does the user want to display all data points, or aggregate them into groups of values ?
